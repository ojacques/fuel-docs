Download Fuel
=============

The first step in installing Fuel is to download the version appropriate for 
your environment.

Fuel is available for Essex, Folsom and Grizzly OpenStack installations, and 
will be available for Havana shortly after Havana's release.

The master node ISO, along with other Fuel releases, is available in the 
`Downloads <http://fuel.mirantis.com/your-downloads/>`_ section of the Fuel portal.
